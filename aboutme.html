<p>I used to be really shy. When I was in the fourth grade, I hated reading out loud afraid of being laughed at whenever I pronounced words incorrectly. If you were to meet me in person, you'd think I'm lying to you just because I'm quite talkative and bubbly now. There's so much to know about me that it's hard to choose a singular starting point. However, I'll start with the basics. :-)</P>

<p>I'm Anne and I'm a rising senior at Mission San Jose High School in Fremont, California. I would describe myself as bubbly, sassy, optimistic, and motivated. I’m easily entertained; all of my friends can hands-down say that I’m the one that laughs the most. Going off of that, I’m a fairly optimistic person. I don’t like to sulk and feel sorry for myself; instead, my mentality is to focus on what I have rather than what I don’t have and to focus on myself rather than others. With that mentality, I set my own priorities and am very motivated to accomplish what I’ve set my mind to. I’m willing to grind it out and put in the necessary work to get what I want. As Tim Duncan said, “Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best.” I’m easy to talk to and very approachable, and try to live life to the fullest. :-)</p>

<p>Much to the surprise of many people, I love school. Being able to go to school and receive an education is such a privilege that so many of us take for granted especially living in the Silicon Valley. I love learning new things as it keeps me on my toes all the time and enables me to think more deeply about the world. Being surrounded by different kinds of people at school gives us exposure to the real world and expands our own way of thinking. In school, my favorite subject is math and has been since I could remember. I get along very well with almost all, if not all, of my teachers, especially my math teachers. Some of the individuals that I admire the most are my math teachers and I am so grateful for those people. I also love learning physics; all the fundamental concepts that are taught in physics are all very applicable to the real world. It’s amazing to see how things work and see the forces in nature. Because of this, I’m interested in tech because I’m curious to see how tech can really change the way we look at the world. It’s cool how a simple program can accomplish such an advanced job and how an application can improve the life of an individual.</p>

<p>I also love playing basketball. I started playing since I was in the fifth grade and I’ve grown to love the sport. It’s become a huge part of my life that I can never leave behind. It’s not only taught me physical skills (like defense + shooting) but it’s taught me to build character. It taught me to toughen up but to never stop supporting my teammates when things didn’t go my way, such as when coach doesn’t play me as much as I wished. It taught me to focus on the details and take baby steps to reach my end goal. It’s impossible to become a Stephen Curry overnight; so many hours, blood, tears, and sweat were shed for him to reach where he is now. It taught me to work with a team as it is a team sport. Sounds obvious but it’s harder than it seems. I love basketball and it’s become a part of me, like a branch of a tree.</p>

<p>I rambled quite a lot but I hope you know me a little bit better as a person. Overall, I’m very bubbly and motivated. I’m very talkative and love to smile all the time. I’m open-minded and love to talk with other people about their thoughts and opinions to broaden my scope of the world. I love math and just learning in general, and I am hugely invested in basketball too. I value being well-rounded in all aspects of life and so all the activities I do are all very important to me. Regarding tech, I’m really interested in learning more about technology and how it can benefit the world even more. It’s crazy how fast technology is moving but it’ll be a very interesting ride. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this, I really appreciate it :-)</p>
