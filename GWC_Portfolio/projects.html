      <h2>Week 1 - Basics of Python</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>During the first week, we learned the basics of python. Everyday the curriculum focused on something different so it kept me on toes a lot. We went over for loops, if/else loops, while statements, and lists. Using these concepts, we were able to create haikus and change the RGB pixel values of a selected image (and much more).
</p>
      <p>The conditionals can get confusing when there are multiple nested loops within a larger loop so it’s really important to understand the fundamentals. We also talked about user input, which is something a lot of programs implement into their code to allow for more user interaction. There are certain rules about user input in python and it can cause the code to break. For example, input is always outputted to be a string. Sometimes, typecasting is necessary when the desired input needs to be an integer. When the specified variable is called, the input (which is a string at first) is changed into an integer. Click <a href="https://github.com/annewang1235/Portfolio/blob/projects/shapes.py" target="_blank">HERE</a> to see the code I wrote for a program that drew shapes. I incorporated user input and typecasting, so that was interesting.
</p>
      <p>Below is a picture of the image that I changed the RGB values of. The left hand side picture is recolored and the right hand side picture is the original. It’s of the Curry family! (Yes, I am a huge basketball fan.)

      <p>Regarding the social aspect of this program, everyone this week was more reserved. We played Mafia a couple of times when the ice wasn’t broken yet so it was slightly awkward.</p>

      <h2>Week 2 - Robotics</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Wow, this was a fun week. We were introduced to arduinos and circuits and just more terminology on the first day. One of the first things we did was build a circuit. Because I already took physics, I knew how to connect wires in a basic circuit - either in series or parallel. My group members didn't though so it was really fun teaching them how a breadboard works and how everything is connected the way it is. When the LED lights were connected in parallel, the bulbs were brighter (less resistance) compared to when the bulbs were connected in series, so that was fun to observe. Funny thing, I actually brunt out a bulb because I forgot to put a resistor in a parallel circuit! Thankfully I wasn't the only one in the classroom to do that so I didn't feel as bad.</p>
      <p>The next few days, we worked with sensors and learned how to connect those too. I've worked with touch sensors, light sensors, and gyros, but that was coded in RobotC. So when time came to program a robot to detect infrared light, my group was slightly lost. We got some help later and was able to figure it out. Our second task was to create a song, which we hardcoded so that was pretty interesting. Code was from scratch  but it was too much. Our last task was to use whiskers to be sensitive to touch.</p>
      <p>And the touch sensor was the biggest frustration of the week. We attached the whiskers properly and made sure all the outlets were connected in the right spot. However, when we ran the code, nothing worked! We asked our TA, Alex, to look at the code. After a good 2 hours troubleshooting, we were still in the same position two hours before. Then we tried to switch robots to see if it was a robot malfunction, but the robot that we tested the code on didn't work either. We had the other TA, Caroline, take a look at the code, and yet she couldn't find anything wrong with it either. All the necessary syntax was there, the logic made sense, it just didn't run.</p>
      <p>So in the end, our robot never worked and it was a bummer. It was a wild ride for sure though and my team made the horrible hours troubleshooting seem less horrible. :)</p>
      <p>Here is a picture of a circuit that we built for our robot (plus the whiskers that gave us a hard time).</p>

      <h2>Week 3 - Django Tutorial</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>This week, we only had three days of class because of July 4th's long weekend. When we came back, we were introduced to MVC paradigms and web frameworks. MVC, which stands for model-view-controller, paradigms help with the user interface and the design process of an application. Web frameworks are software frameworks that allow websites, applications, etc to be created with more ease and efficiency. We dove into Django which is a web framework for python. We followed an online tutorial and it seems simple, however, it was quite the opposite. Personally, I had a few simple bugs which took much longer than needed to troubleshoot so it was very frustrating. Everyone had the same problems so we were all frustrated with Django. I guess that's with anything new though...it'll always be challenging in the beginning until we get used to it.</p>
      <p>On a positive note, however, with the Django tutorial, we were able to create our own blog posts and that was quite interesting. It simplified many things and the url was live (pushed through Github). I was able to finish most of the tutorial before we had to move on to the next curriculum.</p>

      <h2>Week 4 - Security/Binary Search </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>This week, we learned about dictionary attacks and binary searches. Dictionary attacks are used to keep accounts safe by telling the user that his or her selected password's strength is weak, medium, strong, etc. That's the gist of a dictionary attack. It was pretty cool since I was able to have program print out its strength depending on the number of characters that were chosen and/or if the password was an actual word in the dictionary. </p>
      <p>The other main concept we learned was binary search. In this method, all the values within a list/array are ordered in a specific way, such as in increasing order or alphabetical order. When a value is specified, the algorithm takes the array, splits it in half, and determines which "half" it belongs to. Then it takes that half and keeps splitting it into halves until the value is found.  In my program, I used recursion, which is when you call a function with a function, allowing you to loop through it continuously until you find the specified value. I thought this process was pretty interesting; when I told my mom about it, she told me she only learned this when she was in college!</p>
