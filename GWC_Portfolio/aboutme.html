        <h2>A Snippet About Myself</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>I'm bubbly, sassy, and motivated. I'm easy to talk with, very approachable, and very open. People often say I'm very energetic and strong-minded - qualities that make me, me.  As a female wanting to go into tech, I've learned to grow tough skin and to stand up for what I believe in. With that being said, I'm motivated. When I set my eyes on something, I really go for it. I'm willing to sacrifice time and energy to get what I want. In addition, I love to joke around when time is appropriate and I love to laugh. I would say my cure for everything is laughter. I also love conversing with people about different opinions and events that go on in the world, exposing myself to new thoughts and perspectives.  </p>

      <h2>Sports </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>The first time I was ever part of a basketball team was in 4th grade. I was horrible at first, but as I grew up, basketball grew up with me. Now, I love basketball and it's become a part of me. I participated in my schools' teams since the fifth grade, something I am very proud of. I was able to be the JV captain when I was a sophomore at my high school and last year, I was selected to be part of the varsity team. Basketball has taught me so many things about character and life, helping shape me to become the person I am today.</p>
      <p>Since the 8th grade, I have admired Kevin Durant, who still remains my favorite player today. It's crazy how many facts that I know about him but what can I say? I'm a fan! (Go Warriors!!) </p>
      <p>Apart from basketball, I like watching baseball and sprints. </p>

      <h2>Academics</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Since I could remember, I've loved math. It's so fun solving problems. I love how one problem can have a single answer but so many ways to approach it.</p>
      <p>I tutor people for math occasionally and it's been a humbling experience. It feels awesome when you see a student's face light up when he or she understands a concept. </p>
      <p>One of the most inspirational and influential people in my life is my math teacher, Mr. Peralta, who has allowed me to explore my passion for math on a deeper level.</p>

      <h2>Music</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>My music taste depends on my mood. Sometimes, I'm feeling mellow music whereas other times, I'm feeling more upbeat music.</p>
      <p>Some artists that I enjoy listening to include Chance the Rapper, Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, and Khalid. In addition to those artists, I love listening to jazz music, which was influenced by La La Land.</p>
      <p>I used to play the piano until I was in 7th grade. Now, I'll occasionally sit down and play a pop song when I'm in the mood.</p>

      <h2>Tech</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Because I have a passion for math, I've always been interested in tech. It's so cool how engineers can solve problems using code. Technology can be benefit society in so many different ways, and with this industry growing so quickly, I definitely want to be a part of this movement. Technology makes things so much easier, changing everything from manual to digital and decreasing human error. It'd be amazing if I could use tech to create a product that betters society.</p>

      <h2>Nature</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Influenced by my sister, I've come to love nature and being outside in the fresh, open air. My family and I visit Big Sur very often; the scenery is so breathtaking and it's a blessing that we live relatively close by such a beautiful place.</p>
      <p>I especially love anything with water, the ocean being one of my favorite places to visit. Listening to the waves crash onto the rocks relaxes me and makes me feel at peace with myself.</p>
